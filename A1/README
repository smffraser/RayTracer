** COMPILATION **

To compile run these commands in the provided cs488 directory:
  cs488$ cd A1
  cs488$ premake4 gmake
  cs488$ make
  cs488$ ./A1

This assignment was completed on my personal computer. It will be checked on a lab computer.

** MANUAL **

Assumptions:
1) It is assumed when the R key is pressed, the current selected colour will go back to colour 0. 
- This assumption was made since everything else in the program goes back to their default values. Not changing the current colour to it's default on a reset thus might confuse a user.

2) It is assumed that when the active cell is moved while holding the shift key, the new active cell will change to reflect the old active cell, regardless if the new active cell already had a stack of cubes or not.
- This assumption was made because the assignment spec wasn't 100% clear to me. It makes sense that the shift copy should override the previous bar since the user is intentionally trying to copy the previous cell into that new cell.

3) It is assumed that if the active colour is different from the bar's colour, changing the bar's height will NOT change the bar's colour unless the height of the bar goes down to zero (this will then change the colour to the active colour). This does NOT apply if the active colour is changed while the active cell is already on a bar. In this case, the bar immeadetly changes.
- This assumption was made because the assignment spec was not 100% clear to me. I choose to implement the program this way because it flows better with user experience and seems more intunitive in my mind.

4) Debug print out statements like "Space bar pressed" are acceptable to submit.
- This assumption was made because it allows the user to know if the program is getting their input so that they can know if their form of input is buggy vs the program.

Extra Features:
- There are no additional features at this time.

Incomplete Objectives / Code Credit:
