To compile run these commands in the provided cs488 directory:

  cs488$ ./A2

This assignment was completed on my personal computer. It will be checked on a lab computer.

** MANUAL **

Assumptions:
1) It is assumed that, apart from the viewport, mouse movement off screen still "counts" when a mouse button has been clicked. For example, a rotatation will continue even if the mouse goes off the window during the dragging.
- This assumption was made since the assignment only specifies clamping should be done for viewport and nothing else.

2) It is assumed that since we want the viewport to "mess up" the picture, aspect ratio is not used in calculating the perspective. 
- This assumption was made since the assignment asks for the viewport to show aspect ratios scewed, but in the text the matrix for perspective includes the aspect ratio.

3) It is assumed that, apart from the viewport & starting state, any default values can be used. For example, the camera view can start 5 units away from the origin on the z axis.
- This assumption was made since all default value suggestions (except viewport and starting state) were worded as suggestions.

Extra Features:
- There are no additional features at this time.

Incomplete Objectives / Code Credit:
- None
