Assumptions:
- It is assumed when the R key is pressed, the current selected colour will go back to colour 0.
- It is assumed that when the active cell is moved while holding the shift key, the new active cell will change to reflect the old active cell, regardless if the new active cell already had a stack of cubes or not.
- It is assumed that if the active colour is different from the bar's colour, changing the bar's height will NOT change the bar's colour unless the height of the bar goes down to zero (this will then change the colour to the active colour).

Extra Features:
- There are no additional features at this time.
